  - phone
  - book
  - earphone
  - calculator
  - notebook
  - smartwatch


# Suspicion scoring weights - optimized for academic integrity
weights:
  phone: 8                # Highest priority - phones are major violation
  earphone: 6             # High priority - unauthorized communication
  person: 7               # High priority - unauthorized assistance
  smartwatch: 6           # High priority - potential cheating device
  book: 4                 # Medium priority - depends on exam policy
  calculator: 4           # Medium priority - depends on exam policy
  notebook: 5             # Medium-high priority - unauthorized device
  gaze_off_per_sec: 1     # Gradual accumulation for looking away
  repetitive_head: 3      # Suspicious head movement patterns

# Gaze monitoring - optimized for accuracy and performance
gaze_duration_threshold: 2.5     # Seconds before flagging off-screen gaze
gaze_confidence_threshold: 0.7   # Higher confidence for better accuracy

# Repetitive movement detection - tuned for real suspicious behavior
repeat_dir_threshold: 4          # Number of same-direction turns to flag
repeat_window_sec: 12.0          # Time window to evaluate repetition

# YOLO Detector settings - optimized for speed and accuracy
detector_primary: yolo11m.pt                    # Primary detection model
detector_secondary: models/model_bestV3.pt      # Custom trained model
detector_conf: 0.40                            # Base confidence threshold
detector_merge_nms: true                       # Enable NMS merging
detector_nms_iou: 0.45                        # IoU threshold for NMS
detector_merge_mode: wbf                       # Weighted Box Fusion for accuracy
